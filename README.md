# Window Gaps

Extension for KDE's window manager to add space around windows touching a screen edge or other window.

The size of the gap and the layouts and applications to be gapped are configurable.

Please note that this script does not do any automatic tiling. Its purpose is to reshape windows that have been manually positioned with the stock KWin window management system.

## Installation

### Dependencies

`kwin`.

### Installation via graphical interface

**Please make sure to select the most recent version** in the installation process.

**Please do not use Discover for installation** since a [bug](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=453521) causes a wrong version to be installed.

1. Install the script via *System Settings* > *Window Management* > *KWin Scripts* > *Get New Scripts …* > search for *Window Gaps* > *Install*.
2. Enable the script by activating its checkbox, and apply the settings.

### Installation via command line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nclarius/tile-gaps.git
cd tile-gaps
./install.sh
```

## Configuration

*System Settings* > *Window Management* > *KWin Scripts* > *Window Gaps* > configuration button.

You may need to uncheck the checkbox for the script, apply the settings, recheck, and reapply in order for the changes to take effect.

In Plasma versions < 5.24, a bug in the KWin scripting system [[1]](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=411430) [[2]](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444378) may cause the configuration not to be found. To fix this, please execute the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
sed -i 's/ConfigModule/Library/g' ~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/tilegaps/metadata.desktop
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/kservices5/
ln -sf ~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/tilegaps/metadata.desktop ~/.local/share/kservices5/tilegaps.desktop
qdbus org.kde.KWin /KWin reconfigure
```

### Screen edges

Gap sizes are counted from the area that windows maximize to, i.e. from the edge of any panel you may have on that screen edge, rather than the outer screen edge itself.

### Panels/Docks

Gaps on panels are not provided by this extension, but by the panel itself:

- For Plasma: Right-click on panel > *Enter Edit Mode* > *More Settings...* > *Floating Panel*.  
- For Latte: Right-click on panel > *Edit Panel...* > *Appearance* > *Margins* > *Screen Edge*.

If you have any floating panels, specify this in the configuration so that gaps can be adjusted accordingly.

### Sticky Window Snapping

For [Sticky Window Snapping](https://store.kde.org/p/1112552/) to work with gaps, make sure you have the threshold in the SWS configuration set to at least the largest gap size.

### Applications

To find the window class name of an application: Right-click on the titlebar of a window of the application > *More Actions* > *Configure Special Application Settings...* > the pre-filled entry in *Window class (application)* (if it consists of two words, only the second part) is the window class to put in the script configuration.
